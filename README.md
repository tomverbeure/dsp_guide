# The Scientist and Engineer's Guide to Digital Signal Processing

This repo contains my personal [notes](Notes.md) while reading "The Scientist and Engineer's Guide to Digital Signal Processing"
cover-to-cover.

* [Book website](https://dspguide.com)
* [Book on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Scientist-Engineers-Digital-Signal-Processing/dp/0966017633)

Various other resources:

* [Illinois College of Engineering ECED 420 Embedded DSP Laboratory](https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/ece420/sp2018/)

    Useful for exercises to get acquainted with SciPy DSP stuff.

* FM Demodulation
    
    * [Decoding an FM signal using python signal processing libraries](https://ajinkyakadam.bitbucket.io/blogpost/2015/09/17/fmdemod/)
    * [CyberRadio - SDR CUDA based FM Radio](https://github.com/luigifreitas/CyberRadio)
    * [Capture and Decode FM Radio](https://witestlab.poly.edu/blog/capture-and-decode-fm-radio/)

        Excellent guide with theory and practise about decoding FM signals.
